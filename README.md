# Kynto Server

Kynto was an online isometric game written by me, William Robin, and Kelvin Hutkins. Started in 2009
it was my first taste at writing real software, and taught me so much about managing a high-uptime and
mission critical application. Note that I wrote this when I was 16, so the code quality is not representative
of what I can do now - and much of the code is either buggy or unsafe.
